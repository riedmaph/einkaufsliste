# Transformation

This code is mostly for initial transformation. Unfortunalty, it is not possible to do a correct transformation of each single article as the data is quite noisy and no uniformly given. Sometimes those information can only be infered with contextual knowledge. E.g. Lindt Vollmilch vs. ja! Vollmich where the first is chocolate and the later a milk.

To execute, run all commands in these sql files:
- schema (inside database/transformation)
- helper
- preprocessing
- untits
- brandName
- article transformtion
- tagging
